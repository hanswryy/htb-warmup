For the first question we need to check for some "unusual" timestampt. Here I found someone logged in at unusual hour (4 A.M.)<br>

If you look at the IP address for this login (starts with 2) vs. IP from all the other login (starts with 10x), we are pretty sure this login is suspicious.<br>

Ignore me being dumb by using the left side address.<br>
